            from time to time, at any time without notice to you, by posting such changes on the Site.
  
            Our Sites may include the option to purchase physical or digital goods. Purchases on Intelliware Development's Sites
            are governed by Intelliware Development’s Webstore Terms and Conditions.
  
            BY ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE SITE, INCLUDING REGISTERING FOR AN ACCOUNT, INTERACTING WITH THE SITE, OR
            SUBMITTING FEEDBACK THROUGH THE SITE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND TO ABIDE BY ALL
            RULES, TERMS, CONDITIONS, RESTRICTIONS, AND NOTICES IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. If you do not agree to these

            <br>
            <br><b>1. Proprietary Rights.</b> As between you and Intelliware Development, Intelliware Development owns, solely and
            exclusively, all rights, title, and interest in and to the Site, all the content (including, for example,
            audio, photographs, illustrations, graphics, other visuals, video, copy, lyrics, software, etc.), code, data,
            and materials thereon, the look and feel, design, and organization of the Site, and the compilation of the
            content, code, data, and materials on the Site, including but not limited to any copyrights, trademark,
            patent, database, moral, sui generis, and other intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Your use
            of the Site does not grant you ownership of any content, code, data, or materials you may access on the Site.
            You may view the content on the Site on your computer or other internet-compatible device and make single
            copies or prints of the content on the Site for your personal, internal use only. Any commercial distribution,
            publishing, or exploitation of the Site, or any content, code, data, or materials on the Site, is strictly
            prohibited unless you have received the express prior permission of Intelliware Development or the applicable rights
            holder. (The Site may contain some features that enable you to obtain rights to use certain content on the
            Site, such as lyrics, music, photographs, and the like. In such situations, your rights to use such content
            are limited to the rights expressly granted by Intelliware Development in such situations.) You may not otherwise
            copy, reproduce, distribute, or otherwise exploit any content, code, data, or materials on the Site. If you
            make other use of the Site or the content, code, data, or materials thereon, except as otherwise provided
            above, you may violate copyright and other laws of the United States, other countries, as well as applicable
            state laws and may be subject to liability for such unauthorized use. Intelliware Development will aggressively
            enforce its intellectual property rights to the fullest extent of the law, including seeking criminal
            prosecution.
            <br>
            <br><b>2. Trademarks.</b> The trademarks, logos, service marks, and trade names (collectively the
            "Trademarks") displayed on the Site are registered and unregistered Trademarks of Intelliware Development and others
            and may not be used in connection with products and/or services that are not related to, associated with, or
            sponsored by their rights holders that are likely to cause customer confusion, or in any manner that
            disparages or discredits their rights holders. All Trademarks not owned by Intelliware Development that appear on
            the Site, if any, are the property of their respective owners. Nothing contained on the Site should be
            construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use any Trademark
            displayed on the Site without the written permission of Intelliware Development or the third party that may own the
            applicable Trademark. Your misuse of the Trademarks displayed on the Site is strictly prohibited.
            Intelliware Development will aggressively enforce its Trademark rights to the fullest extent of the law, including
            seeking criminal prosecution.
            <br>
            <br><b>3. User Information.</b> In the course of your use of the Site, you may be asked to provide certain
            personalized information to us (such information referred to hereinafter as "User Information"). Our
            information collection and use policies with respect to the privacy of such User Information are set forth in
            the Site's Privacy Policy which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. You acknowledge and
            agree that you are solely responsible for the accuracy and content of User Information.
            <br>
            <br><b>4. SMS/Mobile Programs. </b>When you enroll in a text message service (“Mobile Program”) offered by
            Intelliware Development, you agree to receive offers, abandoned shopping cart messages, and
            other information from Intelliware Development via SMS and/or MMS message at the mobile
            number you provided during the service’s registration process. You may be required to respond to an initial
            message as instructed to complete registration and confirm enrollment.
  
            Messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system. There is no additional charge for this
            service, unless specifically disclosed and agreed by you, but you may be offered opportunities to make
            purchases through the Mobile Program, and you will be responsible for any charges associated with such
            purchases. Message frequency varies. Your mobile carrier’s message and data rates may apply to any messages
            you send or receive through the Mobile Program, including our confirmations and subsequent texts. Please
            contact your mobile carrier for more information regarding your mobile data and messaging plan.
  
            As described at program enrollment and in program welcome messages, including messages sent to a shortcode
            associated with the Mobile Program or by replying to any message you receive from us, you may text “STOP” to
            cancel or “HELP” for customer support information. You can contact customer support directly by emailing
            contact@intelliware.dev using the subject line beginning with: “SMS Marketing Inquiry”.
  
            If you choose to stop your subscription, you agree to receive a final text message from the Mobile Program to
            confirm your cancellation. Our information collection and use policies regarding your information are set
            forth in our Privacy Policy. Mobile Programs that include marketing messages, including abandoned shopping
            cart messages, may use any information collected about you under our Privacy Policy to link your activity to
            your mobile number, personalize messages, and/or link your mobile number to an abandoned shopping cart.
  
            Your carrier may prohibit or restrict certain mobile features, and certain mobile features may be incompatible
            with your carrier or mobile device. Contact your carrier with questions regarding these issues. Carriers
            supported by a Mobile Program are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. Intelliware Development
            are not liable for any delays in the receipt of, or failure to receive, any SMS or MMS
            texts, as delivery is subject to effective transmission by your mobile carrier.
            <br>
            <br><b>5. Unsolicited Materials. </b>Unless specifically requested, we do not solicit nor do we wish to
            receive any confidential, secret, or proprietary information or other material from you through the Site, by
            e-mail or in any other way. Any information, creative works, demos, ideas, suggestions, concepts, methods,
            systems, designs, plans, techniques, or other materials submitted or sent to us ("Submitted Materials") will
            be deemed not to be confidential or secret, and may be used by us in any manner consistent with the Site's
            Privacy Policy. By submitting or sending Submitted Materials to us, you: (i) represent and warrant that the
            Submitted Materials are original to you, that no other party has any rights thereto, and that any "moral
            rights" in Submitted Materials have been waived, and (ii) grant us a royalty-free, unrestricted, worldwide,
            perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, and fully transferable, assignable, and sublicensable right and license
            to use, copy, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform,
            and display such material (in whole or part) and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or
            technology now known or later developed. We cannot be responsible for maintaining any Submitted Material that
            you provide to us, and we may delete or destroy any such Submitted Material at any time.
            <br>

            reserve the right to revoke your right to link to the Site from your website at any time upon written notice
            to you.

            access to and use of your Account, and notify Intelliware Development when you desire to cancel your Account on the
            Site. Intelliware Development will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to
            comply with this provision.
            <br>
            <br><b>8. Software Downloads. </b>In the event that you receive software demos or other software products
